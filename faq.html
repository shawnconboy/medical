            <h3>What is MedTrack</h3>
            <p>MedTrack is the office system that replaces manual paper steps in a medical testing facility. It brings
                scheduling, tracking, and results into one secure portal so every step is simple and clear.</p>
            <p>Think of it as your lab operations hub. It organizes orders, follows each vial through testing, and
                delivers results to the right people.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="who" class="card">
            <h3>Who is it for</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Office staff</strong> use MedTrack to schedule patients, submit or view orders, and answer
                    questions fast.</li>
                <li><strong>Doctors</strong> can schedule patients, review order logs, and see results as soon as they
                    are ready.</li>
                <li><strong>Patients</strong> can check the status of their tests and view their full lab reports online
                    when the office shares them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="how" class="card">
            <h3>How does it work</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Schedule the patient in the portal or request a pickup through the appointment page.</li>
                <li>Label vials and submit the order. Barcodes or tags are scanned at intake for accurate tracking.</li>
                <li>Each station updates status in real time. Staff and doctors can see progress at a glance.</li>
                <li>Results are posted to the portal and can flow into your EMR or EHR if you choose.</li>
                <li>Patients can sign in to see their full report online and can leave a review of their experience.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For larger teams, MedTrack can grow with options like RFID tracking, AI powered queue estimates, and EMR
                or EHR connections. See the <a href="medtrack.html">tiers</a> page for details.</p>

        <section id="why" class="card">
            <h3>Why is it needed</h3>
            <p>Many labs still rely on handwritten notes and separate spreadsheets. That slows things down and leads to
                errors. MedTrack gives you one clear source of truth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster scheduling and fewer phone calls</li>
                <li>Accurate tracking from intake to final report</li>
                <li>Fewer errors from lost notes or double entry</li>
                <li>Simple access to results and full reports for staff, doctors, and patients</li>
                <li>Easy reporting and export for audits and quality checks</li>
            </ul>
